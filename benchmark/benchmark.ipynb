    "\n",
    "⊕ **New model weights**  \n",

    "\n",
    "⊕ **Recursive resolution**  \n",
    "A recursive process is now used, where subdomains found at each iteration are automatically fed into the next. This continues until no new subdomains are discovered or a user-specified maximum recursion depth (max-recursion) is reached, enabling much deeper and more exhaustive enumeration.\n",
    "\n",
    "⊕ **Multi-apex support**  \n",
    "Inference can now be performed with multiple apex domains simultaneously using the `--multi-apex` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "⊕ **Quality of life improvements**  \n",

    "We compare four subdomain discovery pipelines per apex domain that aim at testing the subwiz model in a realistic setting, were a user firsts discover a set of domains using traditional tools (e.g. Subfinder, Amass, Gobuster) and then use this output as input to the subwiz model. The problem is a difficult one since these tools might have already discovered most of the subdomains for a given apex domain, however it remains useful in a setting of exhaustive subdomain discovery.\n",
    "Here are the specific quantities compared:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subfinder subdomains**: This baseline captures the unique resolved subdomains identified by running the `subfinder` tool for each apex domain. Since running subfinder across many domains can be very time-consuming, we have already performed this step and stored the results in `benchmark_dataset.json`, but feel free to do it yourself. This data is from May 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subfinder subdomains --> subwiz v0**: Starting with the subdomains discovered by Subfinder as seed inputs, subwiz v0 (version 0.4.1) generates additional candidate subdomains. This version only uses the input subdomains themselves as context for generation, without incorporating the apex domain information. We use `max-recursion=1` given that v0 initially presented no recursion and these changes came later with v1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subfinder subdomains --> subwiz v1**: Starting with the Subfinder results as seed inputs, subwiz v1 generates candidates using the improved model with apex domain context. Additionally, this pipeline uses the default recursive generation (`max_recursion=5`): newly discovered subdomains from each iteration are automatically fed back as inputs for the next iteration, allowing the model to discover deeper nested subdomains that might only be found by building upon previously generated candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subfinder subdomains --> subwiz v1 + maximum recursion**: Starting with the Subfinder results as seed inputs, subwiz v1 generates candidates using the improved model with apex domain context. Additionally, this pipeline uses the maximum allowed recursion (`max_recursion=50`) to protray full potential."

    "## Analysis of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The benchmark results reveal several important insights about the evolution of subwiz and the impact of its key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Improvement from version 0 to version 1**\n",
    "The transition from the original subwiz to the retrained version of subwiz shows a slight improvement in the number of subdomains found.\n",
    "The former achieves a `5.38`% increase over the baseline while the latter version achieves a `7.58`% increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `2.20` percentage point improvement suggests that incorporating the full apex domain (including TLD) as context provides a small but measurable benefit. This is particularly notable given that Subfinder has already discovered most of the \"low-hanging fruit\" subdomains, making incremental improvements more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Maximum performance of subwiz**\n",
    "This is particularly useful in a scenario where we are targeting one single or a small group of apex domains, hence heavier compute loads are accepted for individual apex domains.\n",
    "Thus, the idea here is to give a sense of the maximum capability the newer version of subwiz brings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum recursive generation shows an improvement over single-pass and default 5 times generation.\n",
    "Version 1 achieves 37.17 subdomains per apex (`7.58`% increase over baseline), while with recursion at max_recursion=50, it discovers 49.20 subdomains per apex, representing a `42.40`% increase over the baseline.\n",
    "By iteratively using newly discovered subdomains as inputs for subsequent passes, the new model can uncover deeper nested structures and subdomains that are only reachable through intermediate discoveries."
